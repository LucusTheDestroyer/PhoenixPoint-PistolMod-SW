# Phoenix Point Pistol Proficiency Mod (Steam Workshop)

### Introduction
Are you tired of your soldiers being rendered practically useless by a disabled arm? Have you wondered how they ever learnt to fire a rifle when they can't even shoot straight with a Pistol? Well, look no further: Your soldiers have just come back from boot camp and they *finally* know how to use a Pistol!

### What this mod does:
• Provides all classes with Handgun proficiency,

• Adjusts the Geoscape inventory UI to show Handguns with all class filters,

• Provides the configurable option to give additional accuracy and damage to Snipers and Berserkers respectively (i.e. Snipers gain bonus accuracy and Berserkers gain bonus damage).

This mod does **not** influence the ability to roll Handgun related perks (such as Self Defence Specialist) in vanilla or otherwise.

### Compatibility
This mod has been designed to be as unobtrusive as possible. As such, it should be compatible with the vast majority of other mods (including Terror from the Void, which it has been tested with) available on the workshop. However, mods that overwrite Class Proficiency definitions or significantly overhaul Inventory UI may cause issues.

This mod can be used with existing saves and can be disabled or adjusted without needing to restart the game.

### Acknowledgements
Many thanks to the Phoenix Rising team for providing open access to the Terror from the Void source code; an endlessly useful repository to learn from. A special thanks also to MadSkunky for without whom this mod would still be in its infancy.
